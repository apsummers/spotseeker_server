# SpaceScout Server

This is the server for the SpaceScout suite of applications. It stores space metadata and resources as well as provides services to the SpaceScout web and mobile apps.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* Django == 1.4 (older versions untested)
* A Python installation (2.6 or 2.7)
* pip or easy_install
* git
* JPEG libraries from [http://www.ijg.org/](http://www.ijg.org/) (Optional, but PIL will not support JPEG images without it.)


### Installing

Use pip to install the app as editable from GitHub:

```
pip install -e git+https://github.com/uw-it-aca/spotseeker_server.git#egg=spacescout-server
```

Enable the RemoteUserBackend:

```
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    ...
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.RemoteUserMiddleware',
    ...
)

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.RemoteUserBackend',
)
```

Add spotseeker_server and oauth_provider to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:

```
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'oauth_provider',
    'spotseeker_server',
    'south',
    ...
)
```

Add the app to your project's urls.py:

```
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    ...
    url(r'^auth/', include('oauth_provider.urls')),
    url(r'^api/', include('spotseeker_server.urls')),
    ...
)
```

Additional settings:

MODULE can be one of 'all_ok' or 'oauth'. If using 'oauth', client applications will need an oauth key/secret pair. The 'all_ok' module is not suitable for production.

```
SPOTSEEKER_AUTH_MODULE = 'spotseeker_server.auth.MODULE'
```

A list or tuple of usernames allowed to use methods that modify server data (PUT, POST, DELETE.)

```
SPOTSEEKER_AUTH_ADMINS = []
```

Custom validation can be added by adding SpotForm and ExtendedInfoForm to org_forms and setting them here. (For example, SPOTSEEKER_SPOT_FORM could be default.DefaultSpotForm or org_forms.UWSpotForm , SPOTSEEKER_SPOTEXTENDEDINFO_FORM could be org_forms.UWSpotExtendedInfoForm or default.DefaultSpotExtendedInfoForm, and SPOTSEEKER_SEARCH_FILTERS could contain or  org_filters.uw_search.Filter or org_filters.sample_search.Filter)

```
SPOTSEEKER_SPOT_FORM = 'spotseeker_server.org_forms.MODULE'
SPOTSEEKER_SPOTEXTENDEDINFO_FORM = 'spotseeker_server.org_forms.MODULE'
SPOTSEEKER_SEARCH_FILTERS = ('spotseeker_server.org_filters.MODULE', )
```

For additional settings, see [some page that doesn't exist.]

Create your database, and you can run the server.

```
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

You can also optionally create some sample spot data:

```
python manage.py create_sample_spots
```

## Running the tests

```
python manage.py test spotseeker_server
```
